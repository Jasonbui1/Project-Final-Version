# Project-Final-Version

This project involves displaying and exploring some different patterns of 'Game of life'.
It includes 3 patterns that I find quite interesting. The user gets to choose what pattern to display and see how much it develops over time.
The program has 5 classes. 3 of them provide the coordinates for the 3 corresponding patterns, and 1 of them provides the object and methods to display and alter it.
To run the program, clone all the files, and then run gofvisual.java.
Have fun!!!
